# script.find-uninitialized-media

This script is made out of the intention, to (easier) find media, which is not correctly initialized in the media-library

With this easy script you have two options:

	* Select the Files you want to rename. Rename them via Kodi
	* Let the script run and cancel to write a list to the disc
